BMI widget plugin for WordPress

The plugin shows a widget to calculate bmi in sidebar, with proper wp widgets control panel availability

The plugin was coded and working at: http://offlineclinic.com/ however it's not working after wp 4.0 or 4.0.1 upgrade

Road map:

I'll be uploading the the initial plugin file once it get working on latest wp (might be uploading the old plugin file too if i don't get it working though)

update
======
found the plugin to be working fine on apache but not on nginx! let me dig more!
